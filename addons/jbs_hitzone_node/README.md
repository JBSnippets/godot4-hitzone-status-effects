A custom Godot 4+ node used to detect a hit from an attack and creates a series of status/effects on the target.

This custom node can be used to detect a hit from an attack by monitoring collisions when a node body enters the selected Area2D. After calling the `hit_body` function either manually or automatically when collision is detected, status/effects are created in the target node body.

## ðŸ§¬ Features
- Automatically create statuses and/or effects when node body hits an Area2D.
- Easily add a dictionary of status/effect resistances.
- Includes `Damage`, `Heal` and `Knockback` effects.
- Built to integrate with [JBS Health Node](https://github.com/JBSnippets/godot4-health).
- Signals are emitted before and after status/effect application.
- Extend and create your own status and effect!
